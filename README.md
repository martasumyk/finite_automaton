# Day simulator

The main porpouse of this task was to simulate one day of my life using finite automaton model.

The model has six main states:

- eat (breakfast, dinner and supper)

- sleep

- study (Discrete math, Calculus and OP)

- train

- walk 

- air alarm (not every day, may be at night)

Also, there are random events that can affect my usual scedule: rain, air alarm etc.

This is an automaton representing my simulator:

The numbers above the arrows represents the probabilities that we will happen. If there is no arrow, the state may come definitely.

Example of usage:

Let`s start our simulation!
It`s 0 o`clock.
Of course, it`s night, so you need to sleep a little bit.
Now you are sleeping.
...
It`s 5 o`clock.
Good morning!
...
Time to eat something for breakfast.
You are eating English breakfast.
...
It`s 6 o`clock.
Now you are training.
It was a great running!
...
It`s 7 o`clock.
You have finished all the morning tasks earlier so you may rest a little bit.
Now you are resting.
...
It`s 8 o`clock.
Now it`s time to go to univercity.
Now you are walking.
...
It`s 9 o`clock.
Now it`s time to study.
Now you are studying OP.
...
It`s 10 o`clock.
Now i`m going to prepare to one of my exams.
Now you are studying OP.
It`s 11 o`clock.
It was hard but you must study a little bit more.
Now you are studying OP.
...
It`s 12 o`clock.
You have studied a lot so it`s time to relax a little bit now.
Now you are resting.
...
It`s 13 o`clock.
You have relax a little bit and now return to studying.
Now you are studying OP.
...
It`s 14 o`clock.
You was so tired that you`ve decided to sleep during a day.
Now you are sleeping.
...
It`s 17 o`clock.
You have relaxed and now ready to study.
Now you are studying OP.
...
It`s 19 o`clock.
It`s time to eat something!
Mmm... Yummy!
...
It`s 21 o`clock.
It`s time to go to bed!
