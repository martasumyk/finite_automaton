# Day simulator

The main porpouse of this task was to simulate one day of my life using finite automaton model.

The model has six main states:

- eat (breakfast, dinner and supper)

- sleep

- study (Discrete math, Calculus and OP)

- train

- walk 

- air alarm (not every day, may be at night)

Also, there are random events that can affect my usual scedule: rain, air alarm etc.
